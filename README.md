# Simulated-Market-Orders-
Implement a simulated market order system where users can place "limit" or "market" orders based on the random price data. Orders should only be "filled" if the price reaches the correct level. - _Goal:_ Recreate a real-world trading mechanism, adding complexity in terms of how user interactions with data impact the system.
